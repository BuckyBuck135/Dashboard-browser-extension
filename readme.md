# The project
I really enjoyed the Personal Dashboard section of Scrimba's Front-end career path, and I developed it further. I was recently quite frustrated by my iPhone weather app after the update, and it now shows me a bunch of useless stuff. That's why I wanted a dashboard that was as customizable as possible. Move the glass sections around, or click the settings button to customize the data and the style of the app. 
Let me know what you think!
Note: you need to allow geolocalisation in your browser to get Weather data. 

# to-do
[] look into Observables and rxJS to handle API calls to refresh coingecko data at a setInterval
[] capture user's input for location of weather data - Google Maps API
[] capture user's input for crypto currency selection
