# The project
I really enjoyed the Personal Dashboard section of Scrimba's Front-end career path, and I developed it further. I was recently quite frustrated by my iPhone weather app after the update, and it now shows me a bunch of useless stuff. That's why I wanted a dashboard that was as customizable as possible. Move the glass sections around, or click the settings button to customize the data and the style of the app. 
Let me know what you think!
Note: you need to allow geolocalisation in your browser to get Weather data. I haven't created a customized input for that yet. I'll paste my repo below, if anyone wants to fork it and try to implement that ðŸ™‚
